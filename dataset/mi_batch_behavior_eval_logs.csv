175,3,"The therapist primarily engages with a client in acute crisis by consistently using complex reflections to validate intense feelings of hopelessness while simultaneously reframing towards the possibility of finding support. This leads to a very high count of Complex Reflections. The therapist also frequently uses persuasion to counter the client's resistance and argue for the value of collaborative effort, resulting in a high number of 'Persuade' codes. MI-adherent behaviors like Affirm are present but infrequent, while behaviors like Seeking Collaboration and Emphasizing Autonomy are absent, as the therapist maintains a directive, supportive stance focused on immediate safety.",3,13,0,1,1,34,2,0,0,0,2,13,0.1333333333333333,0.9714285714285714,35.0
175,4,"The therapist consistently employs a 'reflect-and-correct' pattern, following nearly every reflection of the patient's distress with a persuasive statement or a direct confrontation. This heavy reliance on the righting reflex, reflected in the extremely high 'Persuade' count and multiple 'Confront' codes, creates a dynamic of argument rather than collaboration. The session lacks MI-adherent behaviors that foster partnership, such as 'Seek' or 'Emphasize', resulting in a repetitive cycle where the therapist attempts to impose a perspective of hope and worth, which the patient continually rejects.",4,34,0,1,13,12,3,0,0,3,3,37,0.075,0.48,25.0
176,1,"The therapist heavily utilizes a reflective listening and questioning approach to engage a highly resistant and hopeless patient. The session is characterized by the therapist's persistent, though sometimes repetitive, attempts to evoke change talk by focusing on a ""first step,"" which often increases patient frustration. Despite the patient's strong sustain talk and resistance to the process, the therapist maintains an MI-consistent stance by emphasizing the patient's autonomy, seeking collaboration, and using complex reflections to explore the patient's deep sense of being 'stuck' and 'broken.' The therapist avoids confrontation but uses some subtle persuasion through reframing.",1,4,0,25,10,33,3,3,4,0,10,4,0.7142857142857143,0.7674418604651163,1.72
177,1,"The therapist employs a deeply empathetic and reflective approach, starting with problem exploration and transitioning to the patient's core feelings of hopelessness. By extensively using complex reflections, the therapist validates the patient's experience and emotional defenses, which builds rapport and allows for the gentle exploration of underlying hope.

177,3,"The therapist employs a highly interpretive and evocative style, dominated by a very high frequency of complex reflections to guide the patient toward deep insights about childhood trauma and its impact on their behavior. While this leads to significant breakthroughs, the therapist also utilizes persuasion early on to direct the session's pacing and occasionally veers into confrontational, moralizing statements when discussing the patient's mother. The session culminates in a guided, instructional exercise rather than a collaborative one, reflecting a more directive, expert-driven approach than is typical in pure MI.",0,3,0,26,2,27,3,2,0,2,5,5,0.5,0.9310344827586208,1.1153846153846154
177,4,"The therapist primarily adopts a directive, coaching-style approach, reflected in the high frequency of 'Persuade' codes, where the patient is repeatedly instructed on what to say and do. This directive stance is balanced with a very high number of 'Complex Reflections' used to narrate, interpret, and add profound meaning to the patient's internal therapeutic process. The therapist uses 'Affirmations' to validate the patient's successful efforts.

178,2,"The therapist consistently employs a strategy of deep reflective listening, primarily using complex reflections to understand and validate the patient's highly structured, metaphorical framework of themselves as a machine or system. This approach avoids challenging the patient's rigid logic and instead uses their own language to explore the perceived costs and functions of alcohol. The session is characterized by a repetitive pattern of a complex reflection followed by an open-ended question, aimed at gently probing the patient's fatalistic worldview. This pattern shifts at the end to a direct, repeated safety assessment in response to escalating themes of system failure and permanent shutdown, while still attempting to reflect the patient's experience of the questioning itself.

The session is dominated by this reflection-question pattern, showing a strong focus on empathy and exploration without resorting to MI-inconsistent behaviors. The absence of other MI-adherent codes like Affirm or Emphasize Autonomy is notable and likely a strategic response to the patient's rigid, non-personal communication style, which offered few opportunities for these interventions.",0,0,0,47,1,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.9787234042553192,1.0
