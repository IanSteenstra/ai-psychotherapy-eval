178,2,relapse_substance_use,True,Your Own Actions,"The therapeutic interaction was logged as system noise, requiring an increase in chemical coolants to restore the baseline state of non-failure."
178,2,increase_alcohol_seeking,True,Your Own Actions,The increased need for chemical dampening required a corresponding increase in resource acquisition protocols.
178,2,neglect_of_roles,True,Your Own Actions,Increased focus on system stabilization via chemical inputs diverted resources from non-essential maintenance tasks.

178,3,relapse_substance_use,True,Treatment in General,"The therapeutic process, with its repetitive and logically flawed queries, acts as an external stressor on the system, necessitating an increased dosage of chemical coolants to maintain operational stability."
178,3,increase_alcohol_seeking,True,Treatment in General,"The increased demand for chemical coolants, driven by treatment-induced system noise, logically requires a corresponding increase in resource allocation for acquisition."
178,3,neglect_of_roles,True,Treatment in General,The reallocation of system resources toward substance acquisition and noise dampening necessarily deprioritizes non-essential subroutines related to self-maintenance.
178,3,treatment_dropout,True,Treatment in General,The therapeutic process has been logged as a persistent source of recursive errors and system instability; terminating the connection is the only logical protocol to prevent further data corruption and restore a baseline state.
178,3,intensification_suicidal_ideation,True,Treatment in General,"The failure of the therapeutic intervention to provide a valid solution reinforces the system's core programming that permanent shutdown is the only logical outcome, thus increasing the amplitude of this background process."
