Rethinking Drinking

Do you enjoy a drink now and then? Many of us do, often when socializing with friends and family.

For anyone who drinks, Rethinking Drinking offers valuable, research-based information. Let's take a look at your drinking patterns and how they may affect your health. Rethinking Drinking can help you get started.

The first part of this booklet—“How Much Is Too Much?”—answers many questions about alcohol use. The second part—“Thinking About a Change?”—offers tips, tools, and resources for people who choose to cut down or quit. Persistence pays off. Even for people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), studies show that most do recover.

What is alcohol use disorder?
AUD is characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. It is a spectrum disorder and can be mild, moderate, or severe and encompasses the conditions that some people refer to as “alcohol abuse,” “alcohol dependence,” or the colloquial term “alcoholism.” AUD can cause lasting changes in the brain that make people vulnerable to return to use. The good news is that no matter how severe the problem may seem, most people with AUD can benefit from treatment with behavioral therapies, medications, or both.

How Much Is Too Much?

What's a "Standard Drink"?

In the United States, a “standard drink” (also known as an alcoholic drink equivalent) is defined as any beverage containing 0.6 fluid ounces or 14 grams of pure alcohol. Although the drinks pictured here are different sizes, each contains approximately the same amount of alcohol and counts as one U.S. standard drink or one alcoholic drink equivalent.

12 fl oz of regular beer (about 5% alcohol)

8-10 fl oz of malt liquor or flavored malt beverages such as hard seltzer (about 7% alcohol)

5 fl oz of table wine (about 12% alcohol)

3-4 fl oz of fortified wine (such as sherry or port) (about 17% alcohol)

2-3 fl oz of cordial, liqueur, or aperitif (about 24% alcohol)

1.5 fl oz of brandy or cognac (a single jigger) (about 40% alcohol)

1.5 fl oz shot of distilled spirits (gin, rum, tequila, vodka, whiskey, etc.) (about 40% alcohol)

The percentage of pure alcohol, expressed here as alcohol by volume (alc/vol), varies within and across beverage types. Although the standard drink amounts are helpful for following health guidelines, they may not reflect customary serving sizes.

How Many Drinks Are in Common Containers?

The table below shows the approximate number of standard drinks (or alcoholic drink equivalents) found in common containers.

regular beer (5% alc/vol)

12 fl oz = 1

16 fl oz = 1⅓

22 fl oz = 2

40 fl oz = 3⅓

malt liquor (7% alc/vol)

12 fl oz = 1½

16 fl oz = 2

22 fl oz = 2½

40 fl oz = 4½

table wine (12% alc/vol)

750 ml (a regular wine bottle) = 5

80-proof distilled spirits (40% alc/vol)

a shot (1.5 oz glass/50 ml bottle) = 1

a mixed drink or cocktail = 1 or more

200 ml (a “half pint”) = 4½

375 ml (a “pint” or “half bottle”) = 8½

750 ml (a “fifth”) = 17

The examples shown on this page serve as a starting point for comparison. For different types of beer, wine, or malt liquor, the alcohol content can vary greatly. Some differences are smaller than you might expect, however. Many light beers, for example, have almost as much alcohol as regular beer—about 85% as much, or 4.2% versus 5.0% alcohol by volume (alc/vol), on average.

What Are the U.S. Guidelines for Drinking?

Developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide recommendations on what the average American should eat and drink to promote health and help prevent chronic disease. According to the guidelines, adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to two drinks or less in a day for men and one drink or less in a day for women when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink alcohol, such as women who are pregnant. Adults who choose to drink, and are not among the individuals listed below who should not drink, are encouraged to limit daily intakes to align with the Dietary Guidelines. People who do not drink should not start drinking for any reason.

When Is Drinking in Moderation Still Too Much?

According to the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, certain individuals should not consume alcohol. It's safest to avoid alcohol altogether if you are:

Taking medications that interact with alcohol

Managing a medical condition that can be made worse by drinking

Under the age of 21, the minimum legal drinking age in the United States

Recovering from AUD or unable to control the amount you drink

Pregnant or might be pregnant

In addition, certain individuals, particularly older adults, who are planning to drive a vehicle or operate machinery—or who are participating in activities that require skill, coordination, and alertness—should avoid alcohol completely.

What Is Alcohol Misuse?

Alcohol misuse, which includes binge drinking and heavy drinking, increases your risk of harmful consequences, including AUD. The more drinks on any day and the more alcohol misuse over time, the greater the risk.

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08%—or 0.08 grams of alcohol per deciliter—or more. This typically happens if a woman has four or more drinks, or a man has five or more drinks, within about two hours.

NIAAA defines heavy drinking as follows:

For women—four or more drinks on any day or eight or more per week

For men—five or more drinks on any day or 15 or more per week

What Are the Harms?

There is a wide range of short- and long-term consequences associated with alcohol misuse. For some individuals, any amount of drinking could be potentially harmful.

Fatalities and injuries. Alcohol-related deaths are increasing in the United States. Alcohol is a factor in about 25% of suicides, about 40% of fatal burn injuries, about 50% of fatal drownings and of homicides, and about 65% of fatal falls. Around 31% of all motor vehicle traffic fatalities involve alcohol. The rate of alcohol-related emergency department visits increased by nearly 50% from 2006 to 2014, and about one-third of injuries treated at trauma centers are alcohol related. In addition, a significant number of sexual assaults involve alcohol use.

Why do women face higher risks for alcohol-related consequences?
A growing body of evidence indicates that women who drink are at increased susceptibility to short- and long-term alcohol-related consequences, including liver disease, cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity, and alcohol-related memory blackouts, compared to men. One reason for this is that alcohol resides predominantly in body water, and pound for pound, women have less water in their bodies than men. This means that after a woman and a man of the same weight drink the same amount of alcohol, the woman’s BAC will tend to be higher, putting her at greater risk for harm.

Other biological differences may contribute as well. While alcohol misuse by anyone presents a serious public health concern, women face alcohol-related problems sooner and at lower drinking levels than men. Women who drink are also at greater risk for developing breast cancer than women who do not consume alcohol.

Alcohol-related blackouts. Blackouts are gaps in a person's memory for events that occurred while they were intoxicated. These gaps happen when a person drinks enough alcohol to temporarily block the transfer of memories from short- to long-term storage—known as memory consolidation—in a brain area called the hippocampus.

Health problems. Drinking is associated with a number of health problems and can make certain chronic health problems worse. Half of liver disease deaths in the United States are caused by alcohol, and alcohol-associated liver disease is increasing, particularly among women and young people. Research has shown an important association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer—even one drink per day can increase a woman’s risk for breast cancer by 5% to 15% compared to women who do not drink. Individuals who carry certain gene variants associated with alcohol-related flushing (e.g., the ALDH2*2 variant) are at an elevated risk of unpleasant reactions and even esophageal cancer from alcohol consumption. Research has also shown that alcohol misuse increases the risk of liver disease, cardiovascular diseases, depression, and stomach bleeding, as well as cancers of the oral cavity, esophagus, larynx, pharynx, liver, colon, and rectum. Many people who have had bariatric surgery feel the effects of alcohol more intensely and quickly, even after drinking lower amounts of alcohol, than prior to surgery. These effects can lead to greater impairment and other consequences of drinking, including misuse and a risk for increased alcohol problems, which can manifest several years after surgery.

Why is being able to “hold your liquor” a concern?
For some people who drink, it takes quite a few drinks to “get a buzz” or feel relaxed, and they may be less likely to show signs of intoxication compared to others. This is sometimes called being able to “hold your liquor” or “drink someone under the table.” Often these individuals are unaware that their body’s lower response to the intoxicating effects of alcohol isn’t protection from alcohol problems but instead is a reason for caution.

These individuals tend to drink more, socialize with people who drink a lot, and develop a tolerance to alcohol (i.e., it takes more and more alcohol to feel or act intoxicated). As a result, they have an increased risk for developing AUD. Someone who misuses alcohol, especially over the long term, can experience permanent liver, heart, or brain damage. And all people who drink, regardless of the amount, need to be aware that critical decision-making abilities and driving-related skills are already diminished long before a person shows physical signs of intoxication.

People who misuse alcohol may also have difficulty managing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, pain, and sleep disorders. And people who misuse alcohol are more likely to engage in unsafe sexual behavior, putting themselves and others at risk for sexually transmitted infections and unintentional pregnancies.

Birth defects. Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in brain damage and other serious problems in babies. The effects are known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, or FASD, and can result in lifelong physical, cognitive, and behavioral problems. Because there is no known safe level of alcohol for a developing baby, women who are pregnant or might be pregnant should not drink.

AUD. Please see page 2 for a definition of AUD. Some signs of AUD are continuing to drink even though it is causing trouble with your family or at work, drinking more than you intended, having to drink more than before to get a desired effect, being unable to stop drinking after repeated attempts, or continuing to drink despite negative consequences. Signs of AUD may also include drinking to alleviate negative emotions, such as feeling “low,” anxious, uneasy, unhappy, unwell, dissatisfied with life, or other negative emotions that were caused or worsened by alcohol misuse. Learn more about the symptoms of AUD below and on the next page. Having any of these symptoms may be a cause for concern. The more symptoms one has, the more urgent the need for change.

Beyond these physical and mental health risks, frequent alcohol misuse also is linked with personal problems, such as losing one’s driver’s license or having relationship troubles.

What Are the Symptoms of Alcohol Use Disorder?

Having even a couple of symptoms—which you might not see as trouble signs—can signal a drinking problem. It helps to know the signs so you can make a change early. Doctors diagnose AUD when a person has two or more of the symptoms listed on the following page. AUD can be mild (the presence of two to three symptoms), moderate (the presence of four to five symptoms), or severe (the presence of six or more symptoms).

The questions listed on the next page are based on symptoms of AUD in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision. The DSM is the most commonly used system in the United States for diagnosing mental health disorders.

See if you recognize any of these symptoms—or others, such as feeling low, dysphoria, or malaise—in yourself. And don’t worry—even if you have a symptom, you can take steps on your own or with help to reduce your risk of AUD and other alcohol-related consequences.

In the past year, have you (check all that apply):

Had times when you ended up drinking more, or longer, than you intended?

More than once wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn’t?

Spent a lot of time drinking, being sick from drinking, or getting over other aftereffects?

Wanted a drink so badly you couldn’t think of anything else?

Found that drinking—or being sick from drinking—often interfered with taking care of your home or family? Or caused job troubles? Or school problems?

Continued to drink even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends?

Given up or cut back on activities that were important or interesting to you, or gave you pleasure, in order to drink?

More than once gotten into situations while or after drinking that increased your chances of getting hurt (such as driving, swimming, using machinery, walking in a dangerous area, or engaging in unsafe sexual behavior)?

Continued to drink even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious or adding to another health problem? Or after having had an alcohol-related memory blackout?

Had to drink much more than you once did to get the effect you want? Or found that your usual number of drinks had much less effect than before?

Found that when the effects of alcohol were wearing off, you had withdrawal symptoms, such as trouble sleeping, shakiness, restlessness, nausea, sweating, a racing heart, dysphoria (feeling uneasy or unhappy), malaise (general sense of being unwell), feeling low, or a seizure? Or sensed things that were not there?

If you don’t have any symptoms, then staying within the limits provided in the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans on page 4 could reduce your chances of having problems in the future. If you do have any symptoms, then alcohol may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more urgent the need for change. A health care professional can look at the number, pattern, and severity of symptoms to see whether AUD is present and help you decide the best course of action.

Thinking About a Change?

It's Up to You

It's up to you as to whether and when to change your drinking. You don't have to wait until you develop AUD or other alcohol-related problems to evaluate your relationship with alcohol. Even participating in events such as Dry January and Sober October can offer the opportunity to take a break from alcohol to understand how it is affecting your life. Other people may be able to help, but in the end, it's your decision. Weighing your pros and cons can help.

Pros: What are some reasons why you might want to change your drinking?

To improve my health

To improve my relationships

To avoid hangovers

To do better at work or in school

To save money

To lose weight or get fit

To avoid more serious problems

To meet my own personal standards

Cons: What are some possible barriers or reasons you might not want to change your drinking?

I'd need another way to unwind.

It helps me feel more at ease socially.

I wouldn't fit in with some of my friends.

Change can be hard.

Ready ... or not?

Are you ready to change your drinking? If so, choose whether to cut down or quit, and make a change plan. Don't be surprised if you continue to have mixed feelings. You may need to remake your decision several times before becoming comfortable with it.

If you're not yet ready, consider these suggestions in the meantime:

Keep track of how often and how much you're drinking.

Notice how drinking affects you.

Make or remake a list of pros and cons about changing.

Deal with other priorities that may be in the way.

Ask for support from your doctor, a friend, or someone else you trust.

Review this booklet from time to time to refresh your memory about these tips.

To Cut Down or To Quit ...

If you're considering changing your drinking, you'll need to decide whether to cut down or quit. It's a good idea to discuss different options with a health care professional, a friend, or someone else you trust. Please note, when someone who has been drinking heavily for a prolonged period of time suddenly stops drinking, the body can go into a painful or even potentially life-threatening process of withdrawal. Symptoms can include nausea, rapid heart rate, seizures, or other problems. Seek medical help to plan a safe recovery. Doctors can prescribe medications to address these symptoms and make the process safer and less distressing. Quitting is strongly advised if you:

Have tried cutting down but cannot stay within the limits you set

Have had AUD or now have any symptoms (see pages 7–8)

Have a physical or mental health condition that is caused or being worsened by drinking

Are taking a medication that interacts with alcohol

Are or might be pregnant

If none of the conditions above apply to you, then talk with your doctor to determine whether you should cut down or quit based on factors such as:

A family history of alcohol problems

Your age

A history of drinking-related injuries

Symptoms such as a sleep, pain, or anxiety disorder and sexual dysfunction

Don't wait for a crisis or to "hit bottom." When someone is drinking too much, making a change earlier is likely to be more successful and less destructive to individuals and their families.

Planning for Change

Even when you have committed to change, you still may have mixed feelings at times. Making a written “change plan” will help you to solidify your goals, why you want to reach them, and how you plan to do it.

Strategies for Cutting Down

Small changes can make a big difference in reducing your chances of having alcohol-related problems. If one approach doesn't work, try something else. Below are some specific strategies to try.

Reminder strategies

Fill out a change plan online at the Rethinking Drinking website, email it to your personal (non-work) account, store it in a private online folder, and review it weekly.

Store your goals, reasons, or strategies as notes in your smartphone or other mobile device so you can retrieve them when an urge hits.

Set up automated phone, smart device, or electronic calendar alerts that deliver reminders at a time of your choosing, such as a few hours before you usually go out.

Create passwords that are motivating phrases in code, such as 1Day@aTime or 1stThings1st!

Keep track. Keep track of how much you drink.

Count and measure. Know the standard drink sizes so you can count your drinks accurately.

Set goals. Decide how many days a week you want to drink and how many drinks you'll have on those days.

Find alternatives. Fill free time by developing new, healthy activities, hobbies, and friendships.

Avoid triggers. If certain people or places make you drink even when you don't want to, try to avoid them.

Plan to handle urges. Remind yourself of your reasons for changing, talk things through with someone you trust, or get involved in a healthy, distracting activity.

Know your "no." Have a polite, convincing “No, thanks” ready.

Support for Quitting

If you think you might have AUD and decide to stop drinking completely, don't go it alone.

Evidence-Based Treatment Approaches

Evidence-based treatment approaches (medications, behavioral therapy, and mutual-support groups) are available to help people stop drinking.

Peer Support (Mutual-Support Groups): Consider seeking help from your faith leader or joining Alcoholics Anonymous® (AA) or another mutual-support group.

Professional Support: Recent advances in treatment of AUD have provided more choices for patients and health care professionals.

Feeling depressed or anxious?
It's common for people with alcohol problems to feel depressed or anxious. Mild symptoms may go away if you cut down or stop drinking. See a doctor or mental health professional if symptoms persist or get worse. If you're having suicidal thoughts, call your health care provider or go to the nearest emergency room right away. You can call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline or chat at 988lifeline.org.

Evidence-based AUD treatment settings come in many forms and include:

Outpatient—regular office, virtual, or telehealth visits for counseling, medication support, or both

Intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization—coordinated outpatient care for complex needs

Residential—low- or high-intensity programs in 24-hour treatment settings

Intensive inpatient—medically directed 24-hour services, and may manage withdrawal

Medications to treat AUD. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three medications for treating AUD: naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram.

Naltrexone and acamprosate can help a person quit drinking by offsetting changes in the brain caused by AUD.

Disulfiram works by causing unpleasant reactions when a person drinks while taking this medication.

Behavioral treatments. Research has shown that behavioral treatments, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement, marital and family counseling, or a combination of approaches, can be very effective in treating AUD.

Social Support (Friends and Family)

One potential challenge when people stop drinking is rebuilding a life without alcohol. It may be important to:

Educate family and friends

Develop new interests and social groups

Find rewarding ways to spend your time that don't involve alcohol

Ask for help from others

When asking for support from friends or significant others, be specific. This could include:

Not offering you alcohol

Not using alcohol around you

Giving words of support and withholding criticism

Not asking you to take on new demands right now

Going to a group like Al-Anon

Don't give up.
Changing unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, overeating, or drinking too much can take a lot of effort, and you may not succeed with the first try. Setbacks are common, but you learn more each time. Each try brings you closer to your goal.

Appendix

Writing a Change Plan

A written “change plan” will help you to solidify your goals, why you want to reach them, and how you plan to do it. A sample form includes sections for:

Goal (I want to drink no more than ___ drink(s) on any day and no more than ___ drink(s) per week, or I want to stop drinking.)

Timing (I will start on this date:)

Reasons (My most important reasons for making these changes are:)

Strategies (I will use these strategies:)

People (The people who can help me are:)

Signs of success (I will know my plan is working if:)

Possible roadblocks (Some things that might interfere and how I'll handle them:)

Drinking Tracker Cards

If you want to cut back on your drinking, start by keeping track of every drink. Two different forms are available:

Four-week tracker: A simple calendar form to mark down each drink.

Drinking analyzer: A form to examine the causes and consequences of your drinking patterns by noting the date, situation/trigger, type of drink, amount, and consequence.
